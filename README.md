# Basic Calculator

This is a simple calculator project made to practice frontend development using Next.js. It handles basic arithmetic operations but has several limitations due to its focus on learning rather than accuracy.

## Limitations

- **NO:**
  - Fractional numbers (only integers are supported)
  - Negative numbers
  - Division by zero checks
  - Parentheses and/or advanced mathematical operations
  - Error handling (only basic validation)
  - Standard precedence rules (processes operations from left to right)

## Features

- Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- Runs in the browser
- Built with Next.js App Router
- Lightweight and easy to understand

## Purpose of This Project

This project was created to explore frontend concepts, particularly Next.js. It is not intended for serious calculations but serves as a hands-on learning experience.
