# Basic Calculator (For Learning)

This is a simple calculator project made to practice frontend development using Next.js. It handles basic arithmetic operations but has several limitations due to its focus on learning rather than accuracy.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ **No fractional numbers** (only integers are supported)
- ❌ **No negative numbers**
- ❌ **No division by zero checks**
- ❌ **No parentheses or advanced mathematical operations**
- ❌ **Limited error handling** (only basic validation)
- ❌ **Processes operations from left to right, ignoring standard precedence rules**

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
- ✅ Runs in the browser
- ✅ Built with Next.js App Router
- ✅ Lightweight and easy to understand

## ❓ Purpose of This Project

This project was created to explore frontend concepts, particularly Next.js. It is not intended for serious calculations but serves as a hands-on learning experience.
